# Microblog

A simple microblogging app meant to be a sort of a mix between Medium and Twitter. 

Mostly the purpose of this project is for me to get some experience using Next.js and Google Firebase so that I can use the combination to implement version 2.0 of Franler, my rank-choice friend polling & planning app.
